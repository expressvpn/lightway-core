== About Lightway Core

Lightway Core is a small, multi-platform C library that provides the
foundational components of a virtual private network (VPN).

Lightway Core is the technology that powers Lightway, ExpressVPN’s pioneering
new VPN protocol, built for an always-on world. It makes your VPN experience
speedier, more secure, and more reliable than ever. Designed to be light on its
feet, Lightway runs faster, uses less battery, and is easier to audit and
maintain.

Note: Lightway Core may be referred to by the internal project name, libhelium,
in the source code.

== Development Environment

This project uses https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit] to enforce code standards.

To install pre-commit, run: `earthly +install-precommit`.

== Build and Run (Earthly)

The simplest way to build the static library for Linux, and run all tests is to use Earthly, which runs the build in a containerised environment.
