 * D/TLS is a UDP based protocol and requires the application
 * (rather than the OS as with TCP) to keep track of the need to do
 * retransmits on packet loss.
 *
 * Currently Wolf has timeouts based in seconds. However this is not
 * sufficient for our goal of sub-second connection times.
 *
 * As WolfSSL lacks millisecond timers we use its internal timers but
 * change its definition to be in 100 millisecond intervals instead of
 * seconds. So a wolf timeout of 1 second means 100 milliseconds.
 *
 * By default wolf's DTLS max timeout is 64 seconds which translates to
 * 6.4 seconds. Since it scales from 1 to 64 by a factor
 * of 2 each timeout. The total timeout is 12.7 seconds with this scaling
 * which for our purposes is plenty.
